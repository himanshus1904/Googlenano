## Implementation Examples

### Basic Text-to-Image Generation
```python
from google import genai
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview",
    contents=["Create a picture of a nano banana dish in a fancy restaurant"]
)

for part in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
    if part.inline_data is not None:
        image = Image.open(BytesIO(part.inline_data.data))
        image.save("generated_image.png")
```

### Image Editing Workflow
```python
image = Image.open("/path/to/input.png")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview",
    contents=[
        "Change the background to a tropical beach while keeping the subject unchanged",
        image
    ]
)
```

### Multi-Image Fusion
```python
image1 = Image.open("/path/to/product.png")
image2 = Image.open("/path/to/scene.png")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview",
    contents=[
        image1, 
        image2,
        "Place the product from the first image into the scene from the second image"
    ]
)
```
